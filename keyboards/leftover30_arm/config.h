 * Force NKRO

 * state in the bootmagic EEPROM settings. (Note that NKRO must be enabled in the
 * makefile for this to work.)
 *
 * If forced on, NKRO can be disabled via magic key (default = LShift+RShift+N)
 * until the next keyboard reset.
 *
 * NKRO may prevent your keystrokes from being detected in the BIOS, but it is
 * fully operational during normal computer usage.
 *
 * For a less heavy-handed approach, enable NKRO via magic key (LShift+RShift+N)
 * or via bootmagic (hold SPACE+N while plugging in the keyboard). Once set by
 * bootmagic, NKRO mode will always be enabled until it is toggled again during a
 * power-up.
